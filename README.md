<p align="justify"> Welcome to my HTML Training Space! HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the cornerstone of the web, providing the fundamental structure for creating and organizing content. First introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML allows you to define the skeleton of web pages using tags to structure elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. As the backbone of every website, HTML is essential for building accessible, well-organized pages that form the foundation for design and interactivity. It works in perfect harmony with CSS for styling and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. Known for its simplicity and ease of use, HTML is the starting point for all web development. With continuous evolution, including new features like semantic elements, HTML remains a powerful and vital tool for web developers, enabling the creation of rich, multimedia-driven web experiences.
