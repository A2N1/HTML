<p align="justify"> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used for creating and structuring content on the web. First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML provides the foundational structure for web pages, using a system of tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML is integral to web development, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML is known for its simplicity and ease of use, allowing developers to create accessible, well-structured web pages. It supports a wide range of multimedia content, including text, images, audio, and video. As the backbone of all websites, HTML continues to evolve with new features, such as semantic elements, making it an essential tool for web developers. </p>
